			<!--	<p><b></b></p> -->
				<a name="users"></a>
				<h1>Users</h1>
				<p>Lists the users that are connected to the server. It displays their username, hostname, amount of memory they are consuming (this does not take into account shared memory, so total consumed memory is less) and the number of programs or processes they are running.
				 This is especially useful to discover if a student is consuming too much memory on the terminal server or if they have inadvertantly caused a fork bomb. <br/><br/>If students login or logout during class, simply use 
				this button to refresh the list.</p>
				<p>In a multiple classroom setup hovering the 
				 mouse over this button will reveal the names of the different classrooms on 
				 the bottom info bar. Simply type in the room name into the <b>Input</b> bar and 
				 click Users again to only list students in that class. </p>
				 <p>In addition, fl_teachertool will accept one command line argument: the name of a room. Such that the 
				 initial list will be students from that class. 
				 <br/>For example: #fl_teachertool library </p>
				
				<a name="view"></a>
				<h1>View</h1>
				<p>The view button displays a second window with all the running programs of the selected students in the main window. 
				In this View window a teacher can type in the name of a program (like firefox) then click Select (or hit enter). All instances of firefox 
		        will be selected. Then if the teacher clicks on Kill, firefox will be closed for every selected student. Hence, a teacher can close any program for everyone at once.</p>
				
				<a name="run"></a>
				<h1>Run</h1>
				<p>Useful if a teacher wishes to run a program for students. For example the teacher may wish to show the class a certain website and allow the class to investigate further individually. 
				Simply type the name of a program into the <b>Input</b> box then click on Run. For example, [firefox http://www.cbc.ca] will launch firefox and open the cbc website for  all selected students. </p>				
				
				<a name="find"></a>
				<h1>Find</h1>
				<p>When a teacher instructs a class to run a program and begin working invariably there are some students who have difficulty following instructions. In order to determine 
				which students are on task a teacher can simply type in the name of the program into the <b>Input</b> bar and click Find (or hit enter). This will instantly select those students who ARE running the requested program. This is also useful when a teacher may have specified that students should not run a specific program (a game for example)</p>
				
				<a name="reverse"></a>
				<h1>rEverse</h1>
				<p>This button is especially useful after having used the Find button. If a teacher wants to only select students who are NOT running a specific program (to run it for them or send them a message) then a teacher can invert the selected students so only those who were not selected become selected.</p>
				
				<a name="broadcast"></a>
				<h1>Broadcast</h1>
				<p>Broadcasting allows a teacher to display a window on all the students desktops.  Before using this feature it's a 
				good idea to create a new user account on the server (ask your system administrator to create another user account). Select all or as many students as wish. None 
				selected broadcasts to everyone. Clicking on Broadcast starts up a login window. This is the broadcast window. Login to this session with the broadcast user account.
				Once you login to a Broadcasting session DON'T logout. Simply close the window (by clicking on the top right hand X). 
				That way when you start another session later you will simply pick up were you left off. If you do happen to logout or broadcasting is not working properly then you 
				can kill all the Broadcast windows with the main menu item under File:  Reset->Broadcast or just hit F9. Now you can 
				start another broadcasting session.</p> <p>If some students accidentally close the broadcast window you can simply click Broadcast again and only those who don't have a broadcast window 
				will have it open again. I call this refreshing the broadcast.</p>
				
				<a name="spotlight"></a>
				<h1>Spotlight</h1>
				<p>This button is to be used after starting a broadcast session. It allows a selected student to share control  
				of the broadcast session. <br/>Imagine asking a class "who knows the answer to this question?": a student puts up their hand, then
				you spotlight them and ask them to show the class. Imagine He/she has some trouble with the solution. Then some other student puts
				up their hand and says they know how to do it. You then select them and click spotlight again. The first spotlighted student
				automatically returns to an observer mode and the newly spotlighted student solves the problem as the rest of the class watches everything. Student centered learning at it's best.</p>
				<p>Clicking spotlight while no student is selected stops spotlighting. Only one student can have the spotlight at any given time.</p>
				
				<a name="monitor"></a>
				<h1>mOnitor</h1>
				<p>Allows viewing of selected students desktop activity. Useful for checking if student is involved in appropriate activity.</p>
				
				<a name="control"></a>
				<h1>Control</h1>
				<p>Allows controlling one selected students keyboard and mouse remotely. Very useful for helping a student while not seated at their computer. </p>
				
				<a name="distribute"></a>
				<h1>Distribute</h1>
				<p>Instead of handing out photocopies why not distribute a file (PDF or document) to students home directories. Distribute will NOT overwrite existing files.</p>
				
				<a name="lock"></a>
				<h1>locK</h1>
				<p>Launch screensaver for selected students. Handy for getting attention of class. Requires students to type in their password to unlock.</p>
				
				<a name="message"></a>
				<h1>message</h1>
				<p>Type in a short message into the <b>Input</b> box, select desired students and click this button to send them the message.</p>
				
				<a name="logoff"></a>
				<h1>Logoff</h1>
				<p>Logs off selected students. </p>
				
				<a name="quit"></a>
				<h1>Quit</h1>
				<p>Quits fl_teachertool.</p>
				
				<a name="reset"></a>
				<h1>File->Reset-Broadcast</h1>
				<p>Closes all broadcast windows and resets broadcasting function. Handy, to end a broadcast or if broadcasting does not work properly.</p>
				
				<a name="displaymacs"></a>
				<h1>File->Display_MAC_Addresses</h1>
				<p>For multiple classroom setup</p>
				<p>Displays MAC address of thin clients, which are logged in, on their screens. Handy for multiple classroom setups. Discovering which MAC addresses are in what rooms. Use this function in conjunction with Write_MAC_Addresses to be able to create a fl_teachertool.conf file. </p>
				
				<a name="writemacs"></a>
				<h1>File->Write_MAC_Addresses</h1>
				<p>For multiple classroom setup</p>
				<p>Collects MAC addresses from all thin clients. Writes them to the file <b>fl_teachertool.maclist</b>. Usually in <b>/etc/fl_teachertool or /usr/local/etc/fl_teachertool</b> 
				This file can be copy pasted into fl_teachertool.conf by rearranging MAC addresses according to which room machines are located. Display_MAC_Addresses helps to rearrange this list into fl_teachertool.conf. </p>
